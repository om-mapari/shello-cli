# Code of Conduct

## The Short Version

Be kind. Be professional. Help each other out.

We're all here to build better debugging tools. Let's keep it welcoming and focused on that goal.

## The Longer Version

### What We're About

Shello CLI is built by developers, for developers. We want this to be a place where:

- Newcomers feel welcome to ask questions and contribute
- Experienced folks share knowledge without being condescending
- Everyone can learn and improve together
- Technical discussions stay constructive and focused

Whether you're fixing a typo in the docs or adding a major feature, your contribution matters.

### Expected Behavior

Here's what good community members do:

- **Be respectful** - Treat people the way you'd want to be treated. Simple as that.
- **Be helpful** - Got expertise? Share it. Someone's struggling? Help them out.
- **Be constructive** - Critique code, not people. Focus on making things better.
- **Be patient** - Remember that maintainers are volunteers with day jobs.
- **Be understanding** - People have different skill levels, backgrounds, and time zones.
- **Give credit** - Acknowledge others' work and ideas.

### Unacceptable Behavior

Don't be that person who:

- Harasses, insults, or attacks others
- Uses discriminatory language or makes people feel unwelcome
- Trolls or deliberately derails discussions
- Shares others' private information without permission
- Acts unprofessionally in community spaces

## Where This Applies

Basically everywhere related to Shello CLI:

- GitHub (issues, PRs, discussions, code comments)
- Any community chat or forum we set up
- When you're representing the project publicly

If you're wearing the Shello CLI hat, act accordingly.

## If Something Goes Wrong

### Reporting Issues

See something that violates this code of conduct? Let me know:

- Open a private issue on GitHub
- Contact [@om-mapari](https://github.com/om-mapari) directly

I'll review it promptly and keep your report confidential.

### What Happens Next

I'll handle issues based on severity:

**Minor stuff** (first-time slip-ups, misunderstandings):
- Private conversation to clarify expectations
- Chance to apologize and move forward

**Serious stuff** (repeated problems, clear violations):
- Warning with specific consequences
- Temporary ban from the community if it continues

**Really serious stuff** (harassment, threats, sustained bad behavior):
- Permanent ban from the project

The goal isn't to punish people—it's to keep the community healthy and productive.

## A Note for Contributors

A few things to keep in mind:

- **Maintainers are volunteers** - Reviews happen when time allows. Be patient.
- **Context helps** - The more details you provide in issues and PRs, the faster we can help.
- **Collaboration > ego** - We're all trying to make this better. Work together.
- **Technical focus** - Keep discussions about the code and the problem, not personalities.

## A Note for Maintainers

If you're helping maintain this project:

- Enforce these standards fairly and consistently
- Explain moderation decisions when appropriate
- Lead by example—follow the same rules as everyone else
- Remember that your actions set the tone for the community

## Questions?

Not sure if something's okay? Just ask:

- Open an issue on GitHub
- Contact [@om-mapari](https://github.com/om-mapari)
- Check the [Contributing Guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md)

When in doubt, err on the side of being kind and professional.

## The Bottom Line

We're all here because we care about building better debugging tools. Let's keep this community welcoming, productive, and focused on that goal.

Treat people well. Write good code. Help each other out. That's it.
